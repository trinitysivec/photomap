# Photomap of Sidman, Pennsylvania

Created as an example for [GEOG 4046](https://geog4046.github.io).  

The sheet of csv values will have each row displayed on the map as a pop up including a description and a picture of each location. 

The script for this webaite reads values from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. All of the geographic data was taken from an earlier Storymap assignment, which is linked here: <https://lsu-its.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=afec40ac59604619a7c066d5ee5152ff>
